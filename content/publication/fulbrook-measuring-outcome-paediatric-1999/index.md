abstract: "This paper describes the background to the publication of the paediatric intensive care framework (NHS Executive 1997a) and sets out the case for outcome assessment of paediatric intensive care. Issues relating to mortality and morbidity assessment are discussed and several assessment tools are outlined. It is proposed that functional and psychological outcome assessments are important indicators of the quality of health care provision."
