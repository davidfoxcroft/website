abstract: "This article, the second in a series on career pathways, informs readers of the knowledge they require to conduct clinical therapeutic trials to recognised standards. Many nurses start their careers in research as clinical research nurses. The skills and knowledge they develop through conducting multi-centre studies gives them an excellent grounding in the discipline, organisation and management of research."
