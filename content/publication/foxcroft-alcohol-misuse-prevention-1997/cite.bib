 abstract = {In a systematic review we assessed the methodological quality of evaluations of alcohol misuse prevention programmes for young people, and recorded evidence of effectiveness. Studies were identified through systematic searches of electronic databases; hand searches of all obtained papers, existing reviews and several journals; and mailshots to key organizations, conferences and individuals. Relevant papers were checked and cross-checked by members of the review team, and only those studies with an experimental or quasi-experimental design and positive attributes on a number of other quality criteria were included in the review. After pre-screening over 500 papers which reported prevention programmes, information was systematically abstracted from 155 papers. Only 33 studies merited inclusion in the review, and most of these had some methodological shortcomings. Twenty-one studies reported some significant short- and medium-term reductions in drinking behaviour. Of two studies which carried out longer-term evaluations, only one reported a significant longer-term effect, with small effect sizes. No factors clearly distinguished partially effective from ineffective or harmful prevention programmes. In conclusion, the lack of reliable evidence means that no one type of prevention programme can be recommended. In particular there is a need to carry out well-designed scientific evaluations of the effectiveness of current or new prevention efforts which target young people's alcohol misuse.},
