Design               Cross-sectional online survey.

Participants               Clinicians involved in the care of patients with cancer.                                         Primary and secondary outcomes               Behavioural Change Wheel capability, opportunity and motivation to perform a behaviour, knowledge, beliefs, current practice around e-cigarettes and other smoking cessation practices.                                         Method               Clinicians (n=506) completed an online survey to assess beliefs and behaviours around e-cigarettes and other smoking cessation practices for patients with cancer. Behavioural factors associated with recommending e-cigarettes in practice were assessed.                                         Results               29\% of clinicians would not recommend e-cigarettes to patients with cancer who continue to smoke. Factors associated with recommendation include smoking cessation knowledge (OR 1.56, 95\% CI 1.01 to 2.44) and e-cigarette knowledge (OR 1.64, 95\% CI 1.06 to 2.55), engagement with patients regarding smoking cessation (OR 2.12, 95\% CI 1.12 to 4.03), belief in the effectiveness of e-cigarettes (OR 2.36 95\% CI 1.61 to 3.47) and belief in sufficient evidence on e-cigarettes (OR 2.08 95\% CI 1.10 to 4.00) and how comfortable they felt discussing e-cigarettes with patients (OR 1.57 95\% CI 1.04 to 2.36).                                         Conclusion               Many clinicians providing cancer care to patients who smoke do not recommend e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid and were unaware of national guidance supporting recommendation of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid.},

  abstract = {Aims The aim of this paper was to explore responses to alcohol health information labels from a cross sectional survey of people who drink alcohol from 29 countries. Design This paper draws on findings from the Global Drug Survey (GDS) – an annual cross sectional online survey. Participants 75,969 (64.3\% male) respondents from 29 countries were included in the study. Measures Respondents were shown seven health information labels (topics were heart disease, liver, cancer, calories, violence, taking two days off and myth of benefits of moderate drinking). They were asked if the information was new, believable, personally relevant, and if it would change their drinking. A multivariate multilevel Bayesian logistic regression model was used to estimate predicted probabilities for newness, believability, relevance and if messages would change drinking behaviour by country and information label. Findings Predicted probabilities showed substantial variability in responses across countries. Respondents from Colombia, Brazil and Mexico were more likely to consider drinking less as well as have lower levels of previous awareness. Those from Denmark and Switzerland were not as likely to say the labels would make them consider drinking less. The cancer message was consistently the newest and most likely to make people consider drinking less across countries. Conclusions Country differences in responses to messages can be used to create targeted harm reduction measures as well as inform what should be on labels. The provision of such health information on alcohol product labels may play a role in raising awareness of the risk of drinking. Global comparisons of responses to alcohol health information labels: a cross sectional study of people who drink alcohol from 29 countries.}

  abstract = {Family socialization processes are important influences on behaviour in childhood and adolescence. Two major dimensions of family socialization are Support and Control, and these two dimensions were assessed for their influence on adolescent drinking behaviour. Thirty recently published research studies, which reported the influence of (clearly identifiable) family socialization variables on (self-reported) adolescent drinking behaviour were selected for analysis. The results of these studies were subjected to meta-analysis using a sorting technique. Variables were sorted along the dimensions of Support and Control, and along a Family Structure dimension, which measured parental intactness. Results of the meta-analysis indicated a clear negative linear relationship between Support and adolescent drinking. There was also a negative linear relationship between Control and drinking behaviour. Thus low support and lax control were associated with increased drinking. However, there was some evidence of a possible curvilinear relationship between control and adolescent drinking. A negative relationship between Family Structure and adolescent drinking was also found, i.e. adolescents from non-intact families tend to drink more. The results were incorporated into a family systems perspective. It is suggested that extremes of Support and Control, when measured adequately, may be dysfunctional for adequate socialization into normal drinking behaviour, as defined by social and cultural norms, during adolescence.},

And yet, despite considerable research evidence from overseas, the influence of parents and family in the socialization of adolescent drinking has hardly featured at all in UK alcohol research and education. In this paper we report results from a study in Humberside, England, where over 4000 school pupils aged 11-17 completed an anonymous and confidential questionnaire, and in which we examined the relationship between self-reported drinking behaviour and perceived family life. We found that low family support, low family control, regular parental drinking and an indifferent parental attitude toward the respondent's drinking, were all significantly linked with higher levels of drinking as reported by young people. Interestingly, adolescents with non-drinking parents were heavier drinkers if they also reported indifferent parental attitude or low parental control. These results may have implications for preventive measures aimed at alcohol misuse; toe suggest that alcohol education and health promotion in the UK may be more successful if the importance of families in the socialization of adolescent drinking behaviour were to be acknowledged and this knowledge used to inform practice.}

  abstract = {In a systematic review we assessed the methodological quality of evaluations of alcohol misuse prevention programmes for young people, and recorded evidence of effectiveness. Studies were identified through systematic searches of electronic databases; hand searches of all obtained papers, existing reviews and several journals; and mailshots to key organizations, conferences and individuals. Relevant papers were checked and cross-checked by members of the review team, and only those studies with an experimental or quasi-experimental design and positive attributes on a number of other quality criteria were included in the review. After pre-screening over 500 papers which reported prevention programmes, information was systematically abstracted from 155 papers. Only 33 studies merited inclusion in the review, and most of these had some methodological shortcomings. Twenty-one studies reported some significant short- and medium-term reductions in drinking behaviour. Of two studies which carried out longer-term evaluations, only one reported a significant longer-term effect, with small effect sizes. No factors clearly distinguished partially effective from ineffective or harmful prevention programmes. In conclusion, the lack of reliable evidence means that no one type of prevention programme can be recommended. In particular there is a need to carry out well-designed scientific evaluations of the effectiveness of current or new prevention efforts which target young people's alcohol misuse.}

The method was a search for relevant systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials, in Medline, Pre-Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library, using Orlistat and its synonyms. Identified trials were appraised using a standard appraisal checklist and trial data were extracted for use in cost-effectiveness modelling. Three large multicentre, randomized placebo controlled trials were included in the rapid review. On average, Orlistat results in obese people losing an additional 3-4\% of their initial body weight over diet alone during a 2 year period. There was no strong evidence that this short-term weight loss would have a longer-term impact on morbidity and mortality. The cost utility of Orlistat treatment was estimated at around 46,000 Pounds per Quality Adjusted Life Year gained (extreme values sensitivity analysis 14,000 Pounds to 132,000 Pounds). This rapid review raises some important questions about the potential value of Orlistat in the treatment of obesity. Further research is needed, not only to clarify the longer-term impact of Orlistat treatment, but also to uncover the longer-term impact on mortality and morbidity from short-term weight loss.}

To identify and summarize rigorous evaluations of psychosocial and educational interventions aimed at the primary prevention of alcohol misuse by young people. 2. To assess the effectiveness of primary prevention interventions over the longer-term ({$>$} 3 years). SEARCH STRATEGY: Databases searched (no time limits): Project CORK, BIDS, PSYCLIT, ERIC, ASSIA, MEDLINE, FAMILY-RESOURCES-DATABASE, HEALTH-PERIODICALS-DATABASE, EMBASE, BIDS, Dissertation-Abstracts, SIGLE, DRUG-INFO, SOMED, Social-Work-Abstracts, National-Clearinghouse-on-Alcohol-and-Drug-Information, Mental-Health-Abstracts, DRUG-database, ETOH (all searched Feb-June 2002). SELECTION CRITERIA: 1. randomised controlled and non-randomised controlled and interrupted time series designs. 2. educational and psychosocial primary prevention interventions for young people up to 25 years old. 3. alcohol-specific or generic (drugs; lifestyle) interventions providing alcohol outcomes reported. 4. alcohol outcomes: alcohol use, age of alcohol initiation, drinking 5+ drinks on any one occasion, drunkeness, alcohol related violence, alcohol related crime, alcohol related risky behaviour. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Stage 1: All papers screened by one reviewer against inclusion criteria. Stage 2: For those papers that passed Stage 1, key information was extracted from each paper by 2-3 reviewers. MAIN RESULTS: 20 of the 56 studies included showed evidence of ineffectiveness. No firm conclusions about the effectiveness of prevention interventions in the short- and medium-term were possible. Over the longer-term, the Strengthening Families Program (SFP) showed promise as an effective prevention intervention. The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) for the SFP over 4 years for three alcohol initiation behaviours (alcohol use, alcohol use without permission and first drunkeness) was 9 (for all three behaviours). One study also highlighted the potential value of culturally focused skills training over the longer-term (NNT=17 over three-and-a-half years for 4+ drinks in the last week). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: 1. Research into important outcome variables needs to be undertaken. 2. Methodology of evaluations needs to be improved. 3. The Strengthening Families Programme needs to be evaluated on a larger scale and in different settings. 4. Culturally-focused interventions require further development and rigorous evaluation. 5. An international register of alcohol and drug misuse prevention interventions should be established and criteria agreed for rating prevention intervention in terms of safety, efficacy and effectiveness.}

However, traditional mediation analysis using a product or difference method is susceptible to bias when assumptions are not addressed. We aimed to use a potential outcomes framework to assess assumptions of exposure-mediator interaction and of no confounding of the results. Method We revisited a traditional mediation analysis with a multiple mediator causal mediation approach using data from 17,761 Norwegian young people (13–18 years), 51\% female. Data were collected through a print questionnaire. Socioeconomic status was operationalized as parental education and employment status (employed or receiving welfare); drinking behavior as the frequency of alcohol consumption and frequency of intoxication in the past year; and socialization practices as general parenting measures, alcohol-related parental permissiveness, and parent drinking behavior. Results There was no consistent evidence of exposure-mediator interaction. Formal sensitivity analysis of mediator-outcome confounding was not possible in the multiple mediator model, and this analysis supported the hypothesis that socioeconomic status effects on adolescent substance abuse are fully mediated by family socialization practices, with apparently stronger effects in younger age groups observed in plots. Conclusion We found that the effect of socioeconomic status on adolescent substance abuse was fully mediated by family socialization practices. While our analysis provides more rigorous support for causal inferences than past work, we could not completely rule out the possibility of unmeasured confounding.},

This aimed to: identify and categorise the types of programmes that have been evaluated; assess the cost-effectiveness of interventions; identify areas where further research is required. Sixty-two papers were identified and subjected to a narrative review. Generic programmes focus on knowledge/skills, psychosocial issues, and behaviour/self-management. They result in modest improvements across a range of outcomes but improvements are often not sustained, suggesting a need for continuous support, possibly integrated into normal care. In-hospital education at diagnosis confers few advantages over home treatment. The greatest returns may be obtained by targeting poorly controlled individuals. Few studies addressed resourcing issues and robust cost-effectiveness appraisals are required to identify interventions that generate the greatest returns on expenditure.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, also known as type 1 diabetes, is a life-threatening condition and is the third most common chronic illness among young people. As a result of minimal or non-existent insulin production, people with diabetes must take over the normally automatic task of regulation of blood glucose levels. This is achieved by a complex regimen involving multiple, daily administrations of insulin coordinated with dietary intake and energy expenditure and monitored by blood glucose testing. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness of educational and psychosocial interventions for adolescents with type 1 diabetes designed to improve their diabetes management. Specifically, it addressed the following research questions: (1) Do educational and psychosocial interventions for adolescents with type 1 diabetes have beneficial effects on biological and psychosocial outcomes? (2) Are there types or features of interventions that have been shown to be more effective than others? (3) What evidence is there of the cost-effectiveness of interventions? METHODS: A search strategy was formulated, piloted and refined. Three journals were handsearched, 11 electronic databases were searched and personal contacts, flyers, conferences and websites were used to notify the research community of the review to access further literature. This process generated 10,535 abstracts, which, after screening, resulted in 367 articles identified for retrieval. This number was augmented by hand-searching, personal contact and exploding references, and a final total of 457 articles were scrutinised. Of these, 64 reports describing 62 studies were identified as empirical papers evaluating educational or psychosocial interventions. The relevant data were extracted from the papers and summary tables for each study were prepared. Where possible, effect sizes were computed for outcomes from studies that included a randomised control group (CG) and other relevant information. RESULTS: A descriptive analysis of the 62 studies was undertaken. Most studies (67.7\%) were conducted in the USA and 41\% were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), none of which were UK-based. Only 48\% of the reports provided an explicit theoretical rationale for the intervention. The mean number of participants was 53.8. The studies took place in various settings, evaluated a variety of interventions, involved various interventionists, addressed various components and assessed the effects by a range of outcomes, including measures of metabolic control and psychological and behavioural outcomes. Follow-up assessments were relatively rare. RESULTS - THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERVENTIONS: The 25 RCTs were examined in more detail and three of the most effective were described in depth. Effect sizes could be calculated for 14 studies. The mean (pooled) effect size for psychosocial outcomes was 0.37 and 0.33 for glycated haemoglobin with outliers (0.08 without outliers), indicating that these interventions have small to medium beneficial effects on diabetes management outcomes. A narrative review of the 21 pre-post studies with no CG was performed, including evaluations of interventions conducted at summer camps, interventions for poorly controlled patients and educational interventions. All studies reported beneficial effects. RESULTS - COST-EFFECTIVENESS: Few studies addressed economic considerations associated with interventions, and the lack of information on costs and the diversity of outcomes included by investigators impeded cost- effectiveness comparisons. Shorter hospitalisation at diagnosis is at least as effective in achieving control and avoiding complications in adolescence as longer stays. Home care may result in improved outcomes but may not be cheaper than hospital care at diagnosis. Targeting poorly controlled subjects may reduce adverse events and hospitalisations and may be more cost-effective than generic interventions. There is a need for rigorous cost-effectiveness studies of educational and psychosocial interventions for adolescents with type 1 diabetes that include longer-term considerations. CONCLUSIONS: The following conclusions were drawn from this review: (1) Educational and psychosocial interventions have small to medium beneficial effects on various diabetes management outcomes. (2) Well-designed trials of such interventions are needed in the UK (no completed RCTs of educational or psychosocial interventions for adolescents with type 1 diabetes conducted in the UK were found). (3) The evidence, arising primarily from studies in the USA, provides a starting point for the design of interventions in the UK. (4) Quantitative and narrative analysis of the evidence suggested that interventions are more likely to be effective if they demonstrate the inter-relatedness of the various aspects of diabetes management.

A benefit of the practice may be cost savings associated with shorter Intensive Care Unit and hospital length of stays. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of early extubation and the impact of the extubating clinician's profession on morbidity, mortality, intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, with a subgroup analysis for extubation within four hours or four to eight hours. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)(issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2003), CINAHL (January 1982 to December 2002), SIGLE(January 1980 to December 2002). We searched reference lists of articles and contacted researchers in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials of adult cardiac surgical patients (coronary artery bypass grafts, aortic valve replacement, mitral valve replacement, aortic aneurysm repair). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. A meta-analysis for most outcomes was conducted. MAIN RESULTS: Six trials were included in the review. There was no evidence of a difference between early and conventionally extubated patients shown in the relative risk and 95\% confidence interval for the following outcomes: mortality in intensive care was 0.8 (0.42 to 1.52); thirty day mortality was 1.2 (0.63 to 2.27); myocardial ischaemia was 0.96 (0.71 to 1.30); reintubation within 24 hours of surgery was 5.93 (0.72 to 49.14). Time spent in intensive care and in hospital were significantly shorter for patients extubated early (7.02 hours (- 7.42 to - 6.61) and 1.08 days ( - 1.35 to - 0.82) respectively). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of a difference in mortality and morbidity rates between the study groups. Early extubation reduces intensive care unit and hospital length of stay. Studies were underpowered and designed to show differences between study groups rather than equivalence between the groups. Suggested future areas of investigation: establishing the safety and efficacy of immediate extubation compared with early extubation; establishing the most effective means of pain control and reducing anxiety for patients; systematic reviews of the evidence for different parts of the patients journey through a cardiac surgery episode; and the impact of the profession of the clinician making the decision to extubate.}

  abstract = {The Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ) is based on theory postulating that attributional style is comprised of three dimensions: internality, stability and globality. The ASQ asks respondents to consider hypothetical events and generate their own cause for each event, rating that cause along 7-point scales corresponding to each of the three attributional dimensions. This study examined whether there is statistical support for these theoretical dimensions in a multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) model, in comparison with alternative models. The six negative events of the ASQ were completed by a large sample of University undergraduates (n = 2748). Confirmatory factor analysis of the MTMM model gave chi(2) (df = 113) = 236.89, p {$<$} 0.01, and goodness of fit measures: CFI = 0.98; NFI = 0.97; and RMSEA = 0.02, indicating a very good fit between model and data. This model had a significantly better fit than alternative models, providing statistical support for the MTMM model, and hence the three dimensions of attributional style measured by the negative events of the ASQ.

  abstract = {Despite an increasing awareness of the nonmotor features of Parkinson disease (PD), it remains common for disability to be measured primarily in terms of motor impairment in these patients. The effect of dopamine on mood and emotion in PD is well known, but the extent to which the patient's perception of his or her ability to carry out motor tasks is a true reflection of their actual ability has not been studied. To investigate this important aspect of PD, we assessed the ability to carry out timed motor tasks during a levodopa challenge test in 36 PD patients and used visual analogue scales (VASs) to measure self-perception of "on-off" state and of physical ability. We also recorded aspects of mood on the VAS to see whether these were relevant in relation to the patients' perception. The levodopa challenge test involves assessing patients in both an "off medication" and "on medication" state and so allowed us to observe the patients throughout the range of states of PD that they may experience during the day. Most patients' perception of their motor ability fairly accurately reflected their actual ability on the timed motor tasks throughout the levodopa dose cycle during the levodopa challenge test; however, 5 patients were disproportionately pessimistic about their ability when in the "off" medication state. These patients recorded worse scores on the VAS for aspects of mood and were also taking their PD medication doses more frequently than were the other patients. A better understanding of the patients' perspective of their disability could lead to improved care for PD patients in general and also has implications for our management of patients following surgical procedures, such as deep brain stimulation, that predominantly improve motor symptoms.

  abstract = {Aim Rising mortality and disease prevalence in the homeless have been largely attributed to addiction disorders. This review aimed to assess whether Motivational Interviewing (MI) is effective in changing substance misuse behaviours in the homeless, specifically: 1. reducing substance misuse; 2. increasing addiction treatment linkage; and 3. whether MI effectiveness varied according to the different levels of social disadvantage within homeless populations. Method Electronic databases and other sources were searched (to July 2021) for relevant randomized trials and comparative studies. Risk of bias in included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. A Narrative Synthesis framework was applied to included studies. Moderator variables subgroup analyses were planned a priori. PROSPERO study protocol registration: CRD42019134312 Results The searches found 1885 records; after application of inclusion criteria n~=~11 studies from 30 articles were included in the review, all from the United States. There was a paucity of research regarding MI effectiveness for substance misuse outcomes in homeless populations, with a focus on short-term rather than long-term impacts. Risk of bias was generally low but was high for detection bias in most studies. MI appeared to be more effective overall amongst adult homeless persons, yielding consistently small effects, and alcohol use behaviours seemed to be more amenable to change as a result of MI/MET (Motivational Enhancement Therapy) interventions than drug use ones. Limited evidence with high risk of bias indicated that social gradient may attenuate MI effectiveness within the young homeless population, with no impact in the most disadvantaged. Conclusions The review's mixed findings discourage the use of MI as a stand-alone substance use intervention in homeless populations. Although the review findings did not identify MI effectiveness for substance use according to the external level of social disadvantage faced by homeless persons, this should be a focus for further research.},

Descriptive statistics reported the efficacy and efficiency of the study processes, and the rates of licensed premises recruitment, and participant recruitment and attrition. Mean and the 95\% confidence interval (CI) compared alcohol consumption between conditions. The mean, standard deviation (SD) and CI of UK units of alcohol consumed were used to calculate a sample size for a RCT. Responses to participant questionnaires and duration of participation in study sessions between conditions were analysed.                                                        Results               Components of the study protocol were effective and efficient. The venue recruitment rate was less than anticipated. The participant recruitment rate was greater than anticipated. The rate of attrition was 23\% and varied by less than 1\% according to the arm of the trial. There was a reduction of alcohol consumed under the intervention conditions. Estimated mean difference, and 95\% CI (UK units): −\,3.76 (−\,5.01 to −\,2.52). The sample size required for a RCT is 53. Participants did not find one lager more pleasant in taste: (on a scale of one to 10) −\,0.95 (−\,2.11 to 0.21). Participants found the reduced-strength lager less enjoyable: (on a scale of one to 10) −\,1.44 (−\,2.64 to −\,0.24) and they perceived themselves to be less intoxicated after consuming it: (on a scale of one to 10) −\,1.00 (−\,1.61 to −\,0.40).                                         Conclusion               A RCT is feasible with minor alterations to the study protocol and scoping work to establish different brands of alcohol that are more alike and more enjoyable than the products used in the pilot trial.

  abstract = {Objectives               The Strengthening Families Programme 10–14 (SFP10-14) is a USA-developed universal group-based intervention aiming to prevent substance misuse by strengthening protective factors within the family. This study evaluated a proportionate universal implementation of the adapted UK version (SFP10-14UK) which brought together families identified as likely/not likely to experience/present challenges within a group setting.                                         Design               Pragmatic cluster-randomised controlled effectiveness trial, with families as the unit of randomisation and embedded process and economic evaluations.                                         Setting               The study took place in seven counties of Wales, UK.                                         Participants               715 families (919 parents/carers, 931 young people) were randomised.                                         Interventions               Families randomised to the intervention arm received the SFP10-14 comprising seven weekly sessions. Families in intervention and control arms received existing services as normal.                                         Outcome measures               Primary outcomes were the number of occasions young people reported drinking alcohol in the last 30 days; and drunkenness during the same period, dichotomised as ‘never’ and ‘1–2 times or more’. Secondary outcomes examined alcohol/tobacco/substance behaviours including: cannabis use; weekly smoking (validated by salivary cotinine measures); age of alcohol initiation; frequency of drinking {$>$}5 drinks in a row; frequency of different types of alcoholic drinks; alcohol-related problems. Retention: primary analysis included 746 young people (80.1\%) (alcohol consumption) and 732 young people (78.6\%) (drunkenness).                                         Results               There was no evidence of statistically significant between-group differences 2 years after randomisation for primary outcomes (young people’s alcohol consumption in the last 30 days adjusted OR=1.11, 95\% CI 0.72 to 1.71, p=0.646; drunkenness in the last 30 days adjusted OR=1.46, 95\% CI 0.83 to 2.55, p=0.185). There were no statistically significant between-group differences for other substance use outcomes, or those relating to well-being/stress, and emotional/behavioural problems.                                         Conclusions               Previous evidence of effectiveness was not replicated. Findings highlight the importance of evaluating interventions when they are adapted for new settings.

  abstract = {Background: The effect of alcohol portrayals and advertising on the drinking behaviour of young people is a matter of much debate. We evaluated the relationship between exposure to alcohol advertising, marketing and portrayal on subsequent drinking behaviour in young people by systematic review of cohort (longitudinal) studies. Methods: studies were identified in October 2006 by searches of electronic databases, with no date restriction, supplemented with hand searches of reference lists of retrieved articles. Cohort studies that evaluated exposure to advertising or marketing or alcohol portrayals and drinking at baseline and assessed drinking behaviour at follow-up in young people were selected and reviewed. Results: seven cohort studies that followed up more than 13,000 young people aged 10 to 26 years old were reviewed. The studies evaluated a range of different alcohol advertisement and marketing exposures including print and broadcast media. Two studies measured the hours of TV and music video viewing. All measured drinking behaviour using a variety of outcome measures. Two studies evaluated drinkers and non-drinkers separately. Baseline non-drinkers were significantly more likely to have become a drinker at follow-up with greater exposure to alcohol advertisements. There was little difference in drinking frequency at follow-up in baseline drinkers. In studies that included drinkers and non-drinkers, increased exposure at baseline led to significant increased risk of drinking at follow-up. The strength of the relationship varied between studies but effect sizes were generally modest. All studies controlled for age and gender, however potential confounding factors adjusted for in analyses varied from study to study. Important risk factors such as peer drinking and parental attitudes and behaviour were not adequately accounted for in some studies. Conclusion: data from prospective cohort studies suggest there is an association between exposure to alcohol advertising or promotional activity and subsequent alcohol consumption in young people. Inferences about the modest effect sizes found are limited by the potential influence of residual or unmeasured confounding.},

Three months versus six months programme within modified TC, and six months versus 12 months programme within standard TC: completion rate higher in the three months programme and retention rate (40 days) significantly greater with the 12 months than 6 months programme. Two trials evaluated TCs within a prison setting: one reported significantly fewer re incarcerated 12 months after release from prison in the TC group compared with no treatment, RR 0.68 (95\% CI 057, 0.81). In the other, people treated in prison with TC compared with Mental Health Treatment Programmes showed significantly fewer re incarcerations RR 0.28 (95\% CI 0.13, 0.63), criminal activity 0.69 (95\% CI 0.52, 0.93) and alcohol and drug offences 0.62 (95\% CI 0.43, 0.90) 12 months after release from prison.|There is little evidence that TCs offer significant benefits in comparison with other residential treatment, or that one type of TC is better than another. Prison TC may be better than prison on it's own or Mental Health Treatment Programmes to prevent re-offending post-release for in-mates.
